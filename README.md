### Introduction

Backbone.js is a framework for developing single page applications(SPA), introduced by Jeremy Ashkenas, in the year 2010. He is the author of Coffeescript, which is a programming language that transcompiles to javascript. Anyhow which is irrelevant to the current topic, let’s not get involved in that.

Backbone.js is not an independent framework, it depends on underscore.js framework for template and utility functionality, and on jQuery for wiring functionality.  Backbone.js also can be used with the jQuery, mustache.js and combinations like that. Of course, backbone.js is following MVC pattern, MVC can be Model-View-Controller and often it is termed as Model-View-Collection here.
